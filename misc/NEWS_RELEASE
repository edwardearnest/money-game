For Immediate Release:

From Actions Have Consequences Studios comes the completely
unanticipated game 'money game'.  Featuring steller gameplay without
any graphics whatsoever this likely-never-to-be-released title is the
mostly unknown title of the year, with hundreds of hours of
never-before-seen gameplay, most of which consists of balancing your
checkbook and discovering you have -- depending on the day -- either
slightly overdrafted or never had any money in the first place.
